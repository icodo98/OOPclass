You must answer at least 4 questions, but the remaining ones are optional. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: helper method move is good method which can be appiled to my code.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: UpdateIndex method. Used every other method. reduced my code dramatically.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: equals method. it could be more simpler. I didnt have to call both iterator.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A: I choose first index to 0 for array, but shoose it to middel of array can make resize and arraycopy easier.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: How to use iterator and hasNext(), Next() means. I wasted so much time for this.

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: I'll change equals method to more cleaner

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: He used two private nodes. it could make the code more easier.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: used enhanced for loop for equals method.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: Pointing inside nodes are dirty. Unreadable and Explicity is bad.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing LinkedListDeque?

A: I should have used helper method more. His code is neat and simple.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing LinkedListDeque, if anything?

A: Overloading method. I have a hard time for making method Name hardly.

Q: If you wrote LinkedListDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: I will use more hepler method.

Q: Did you like this design review process? Anything we should do differently next time?
